# bfs_project

This project was inspired by a class assignment. The class assigment was in java, and the startup time was prohibitvely slow for testing, so I figured I've take a crack at it in c++. The result was a program which parsed all 1.3 GB of data and created a graph struture repersenting it in less than 5 seconds. The breadth first search algotrithm was able to look at over 2000 nodes per <i>millisecond</i>.

I am quite pleased with the results of this challenge, and I learned a lot about c++. Specifically, how to debug, how to set up CMake, how to profile c++ with valgrind, and the benifits to be had with finding optimized libraries.
